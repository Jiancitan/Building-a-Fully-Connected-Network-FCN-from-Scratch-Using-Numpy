# Building-a-Fully-Connected-Network-FCN-from-Scratch-Using-Numpy

o	Description: This project involves developing a Fully Connected Network (FCN) from scratch using Numpy. The primary dataset used for this project is the Fashion_MNIST dataset from keras.datasets. The project is part of the ADY201m course and aims to provide a hands-on experience in building neural networks without relying on high-level libraries.

o	Dataset: Fashion_MNIST from keras.datasets

o	Skills Used: Numpy, neural network design, data preprocessing, machine learning.

o	Results: Successfully implemented a fully connected network capable of classifying Fashion_MNIST images with a training accuracy of 80.95%.
